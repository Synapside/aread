As of 07 June 2013, command line aread will not be updated until further notice. Instructions for command line aread 0.5 are below, but I recommend that you use the online version of aread instead.

For command line version of aread:
(Warning: command line aread will not work on every computer.)
use the -r flag for radius, the -s flag for side length, and the -a flag for apothem, followed by the value of the appropriate measure. Then include the number of sides on the polygon at the end.  For example:

./aread -r 5 8


For online aread:

visit www.synapside.com/aread.
Fill in the forms and do what you are prompted to.
